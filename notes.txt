Ran into MIME type issue where the broswer couldn't find the CSS files when I navigated to another page
The issue was the file. An issue like that will most likely be the file path. In this case I had a lot of things
correct but my href were written like this href="./stylesheets/bootstrap.css" instead of this href="/stylesheets/bootstrap.css"
This YouTube channel helped me figure it out. Idk what he is saying the I understand the code.
